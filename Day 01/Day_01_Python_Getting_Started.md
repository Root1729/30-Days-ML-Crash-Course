## 2. How Python Works and How to Run It

Python is an interpreted language, meaning it does not require explicit compilation. Instead, it is executed line by line by the Python interpreter.

### **Installing and Running Python**

1. **Install Python**

   - Download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   - Run the installer and check **“Add Python to PATH”**
   - Verify installation:
     ```sh
     python --version
     ```

2. **Running Python in Different Ways**

   - **Interactive Mode (REPL)**: Open a terminal and type `python` (or `python3` on macOS/Linux) to enter the interactive shell.
   - **Running a Python Script**:
     ```sh
     python script.py
     ```
   - **Using an IDE (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm)**: Write Python scripts and execute them within the editor.
   - **Jupyter Notebooks**: Use for data science and research-based projects.

### **How Python Code Compiles**

When a Python script runs:

1. The Python interpreter translates the script into **bytecode**.
2. Bytecode is stored temporarily (or in `__pycache__`).
3. The Python Virtual Machine (PVM) executes the bytecode.


### **JIT Compilation in Python**

Some Python implementations like **PyPy** use **JIT compilation** to convert bytecode into machine code at runtime, improving execution speed.

### **CPython and JIT Compilation**

**CPython**, the default Python implementation, does not use JIT compilation but executes bytecode in the PVM. Alternatives like **PyPy** use JIT for faster performance.

## 3. Setting Up Python in VS Code

To start coding in Python, we will set up Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as our IDE.

### **Step 1: Install Python**

1. Download Python from the official site: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Install Python, making sure to check the option **“Add Python to PATH”**

### **Step 2: Install Visual Studio Code**

1. Download and install VS Code: [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### **Step 3: Install Python Extension in VS Code**

1. Open VS Code
2. Go to Extensions (Ctrl + Shift + X)
3. Search for **Python** and install the extension by Microsoft

### **Step 4: Configure VS Code for Python Development**

1. Open VS Code and create a new workspace.
2. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
   ```
3. Select the Python interpreter by clicking on the bottom-left Python version and choosing the correct environment.
4. Enable auto-formatting by configuring the `settings.json` file:
   ```json
   {
       "editor.formatOnSave": true,
       "python.linting.enabled": true
   }
   ```

### **Step 5: Verify Installation and Run Code**

1. Create a new file `test.py`
2. Write the following code and save:
   ```python
   print("Hello, World!")
   ```
3. Run the file using **Run Python File in Terminal** or the built-in debugger.

This setup ensures a smooth Python development experience in VS Code!
